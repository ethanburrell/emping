    CS170 Midterm Review:

    Divide-and-Conquer:
    In computer science, divide and conquer is an algorithm design paradigm based on multi-branched recursion. A divide and conquer algorithm works by recursively breaking down into two or more sub-parts of the same or related type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly. The solutions to the divide and conquer sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original divide and conquer.

    Minimum Spanning Tree:
    A minimum spanning tree (MST) is a subset of the connected, edge-weighted (undirected graph that connects all the vertices together, without any cycles and with the minimum possible total  weight. That is, it is a minimum spanning tree whose sum of weights is as small as possible.

    Note: Minimum Spanning Tree often comes up in True and False Qâ€™s.

    Fast Fourier Transform:
    A Fast Fourier transform (FFT) is an algorithm that samples a signal over a period of time (or space) and divides it into its frequency components.These components of a Fast Fourier Transform are single sinusoidal oscillations at distinct frequencies each with their own amplitude and phase. Fast Fourier Transform

    Dynamic Programming:
    Dynamic Programming is a method for breaking it down into a collection of simpler sub parts, solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing their solutions using a memory-based data structure (array, map,etc). Each of the dynamic programming  solutions is indexed in some way, typically based on the values of its input parameters, so as to facilitate its lookup.

    Network Flows:
    In graph theory, a network flows (also known as a transportation network) is a directed graph where each path has a capacity and each path receives a network flows.
    Properties:
    The amount of flow on the edge of a network flow graph cannot exceed the capacity.
    Network flow are used to model many real world scenario.

    Duality:
    In mathematical optimization theory, duality or the duality principle is the principle that optimization works may be viewed from either of two perspectives, the primal issue or the duality. The solution to the dual provides a lower bound to the solution of the primal.
