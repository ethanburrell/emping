## Welcome To My Blog
Hello, My name is Ethan Burrell, I am a Berkeley EECS Student going into my Freshman year in 2017, hoping to graduate in 2021. 

This blog will chronicle my adventures over my time in college, act for a way to learn more about me, and show off projects that I have worked on.

Until next time.
